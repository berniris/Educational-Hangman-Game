## Constraints/Obstacles
Initially I thought time was going to be a constraint but it turned out not to be. Of course my limited understanding of jQuery was a constraint but I think I've really improved with my ability to use the library.  

My biggest hurdles were definitely getting questions to append to the screen one at a time and figuring out the logic to retrieve the next question. I had two questions appearing for each turn at one point because I was improperly using the append() method. Only after I learned how to clear text from my screen did I get the questions to append one at a time. 

## Approach

I wanted to create a game that features trivia from popular horror movies. I wanted the game to run without too many button clicks or a need for a ‘next button’ so each new question appears automatically after the user makes a guess.
After writing my pseudocode, I decided to begin at the start of the game with the landing page. It was very difficult to resist the urge to style the landing page and only focus on the logic but prioritizing logic before design really helped me in the end. 

## Final Thoughts

The extra day to work on our projects was a life saver. I learned a lot about jquery and the way that Javascript behaves and runs under the hood. I also feel like my debugging skills have improved over the course of creating my game. Overall I was pleased with the amount of time allotted and what I was able to make.
